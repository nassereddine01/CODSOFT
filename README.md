CODSOFT Data Science Internship Tasks
Welcome to my CODSOFT Data Science Internship repository! ðŸš€ Here, I've documented my journey through various data science tasks as part of the internship program.

Tasks Overview
Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
In this task, I utilized the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The code, dataset, and a video walkthrough are available in the respective directories.

Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python
For this task, I delved into historical movie data, applying regression techniques in Python to predict movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, and actors. The code, dataset, and a detailed video explanation are provided.

Task 3: Iris Flower Classification
Here, I developed a machine learning model using the Iris dataset to accurately classify Iris flowers into different species based on sepal and petal measurements. The repository includes the code, dataset, and a video walkthrough of the classification process.

Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python
In this task, I forecasted future sales using Python and machine learning techniques, considering factors like advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation. The code, dataset, and a video presentation of the sales prediction process are available.
